## What is C++ Programming Language ?
#### C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that
  *  is a better C
  *  supports data abstraction
  *  supports object-oriented programming
  *  supports generic programming 

## What is generic programming ?

#### *Generic programming is programming based on parameterization: You can parameterize a type with another (such as a vector with its element types) and an algorithm with another (such as a sort function with a comparison function). The aim of generic programming is to generalize a useful algorithm or data structure to its most general and useful form. For example, a vector of integers is fine and so is a function that finds the largest value in a vector of integers. However, a generic solution that provides a vector of any type the user cares to use and a function that finds the largest value in any vector is better.*
