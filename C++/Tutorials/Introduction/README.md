### *From the viewpoint of the creator of C++ programming language [Bjarne Stroustrup's](https://www.stroustrup.com/)*

## 1. What is C++ Programming Language ?
#### C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias towards systems programming that
  *  is a better C
  *  supports data abstraction
  *  supports object-oriented programming
  *  supports generic programming 

## 2. What is generic programming ?

#### *Generic programming is programming based on parameterization: You can parameterize a type with another (such as a vector with its element types) and an algorithm with another (such as a sort function with a comparison function). The aim of generic programming is to generalize a useful algorithm or data structure to its most general and useful form. For example, a vector of integers is fine and so is a function that finds the largest value in a vector of integers. However, a generic solution that provides a vector of any type the user cares to use and a function that finds the largest value in any vector is better.*

## 3.  Is C a subset of C++?
#### *In the strict mathematical sense, C isn't a subset of C++. There are programs that are valid C but not valid C++ and even a few ways of writing code that has a different meaning in C and C++. However, C++ supports every programming technique supported by C. Every C program can be written in essentially the same way in C++ with the same run-time and space efficiency. It is not uncommon to be able to convert tens of thousands of lines of ANSI C to C-style C++ in a few hours. Thus, C++ is as much a superset of ANSI C as ANSI C is a superset of K&R C and much as ISO C++ is a superset of C++ as it existed in 1985.*
